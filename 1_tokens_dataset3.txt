propose
efficient
algorithm
architecture
codesign
for
attention
in
nlp
by
removing
computations
and
dram
accesses
of
unimportant
tokens
heads
of
the
model
in
a

something
like
this
a
survey
of
approaches
for
nlp
in
low

scenarios
from
distant

you
will
find
it

what
is
natural
language
processing
natural
language
processing
or
nlp
for
short
is
broadly
defined
as
the
automatic
manipulation
of
natural
language
like
speech
and
text
by
software
the
study
of
natural
language
processing
has
been
around
for
more
than
50
years
and
grew
out
of
the
field
of
linguistics
with
the
rise
of
computers
natural
language
refers
to
the
way
we
humans
communicate
with
each
other
namely
speech
and
text
we
are
surrounded
by
text
think
about
how
much
text
you
see
each
day
signs
menus
email
sms
web
pages
and
so
much
more…
the
list
is
endless
now
think
about
speech
we
may
speak
to
each
other
as
a
species
more
than
we
write
it
may
even
be
easier
to
learn
to
speak
than
to
write
voice
and
text
are
how
we
communicate
with
each
other
given
the
importance
of
this
type
of
data
we
must
have
methods
to
understand
and
reason
about
natural
language
just
like
we
do
for
other
types
of
data
