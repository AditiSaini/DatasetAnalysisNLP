Hotel Reviews

1) The Fullerton Hotel Singapore
With stately Doric columns, cornices and coffered ceilings, the iconic Fullerton Hotel stands like a mighty fortress against a shining cityscape at the mouth of the Singapore River. High-ceiling suites, Italian marble floors and a lobby museum meld ultra luxury with the building’s revered history.

Location: 9 / 10
Located in the heart of colonial Singapore, just steps away from the pedestrian 1870 Cavenagh Bridge fronting the Asian Civilizations Museum. Walk another few minutes to Raffles Landing, marking the site of the city’s 1819 origin; the New and Old Parliament buildings, National Gallery, and Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall.

Three minutes to Boat Quay, a lively row of historic trading houses with restaurants and bars, and another five-minute walk to Quay Clarke’s bustling nightlife bathed in shifting red and green lights. Chinatown and Little India are only a few subway stops away.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
It was once Singapore’s largest central edifice, the 1928 Fullerton Building housed the General Post Office, a social club and government departments. Retaining its behemoth neoclassical façade, the hotel was proclaimed Singapore’s 71st National Monument after it opened.

The lobby’s museum-like Fullerton Heritage Gallery showcases this history, also explained with two complimentary guided tours. A luxurious feel prevails with the marble two-tiered stairwell dominating the pillared, elegant central atrium accented with leafy palm trees.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
Smiles and thoroughness to detail abound with above and beyond service as a desk clerk, for example, will leave his post to retrieve water bottles for overheated guests. The outdoor second-level infinity pool also provides cooling relief against the backdrop of Doric columns with river and Marina Bay views.

Massive, rounded chandeliers illuminate three ballrooms holding up to 600, while the fourth-floor Straits Room is an ideal wedding and banquet venue for up to 220 guests. A 10-minute walk leads to several other Fullerton Heritage waterfront properties with restaurants and entertainment venues, including the sister Fullerton Bay Hotel.

Rooms: 9 / 10
A soft-vanilla colour theme dominates. From elegant Courtyard and balconied Premier Quay rooms to high-ceiling, two-story lofts and suites with outdoor terraces, the Fullerton’s 400 rooms offer many choices with panoramic skyline and/or waterside views. Standard rooms feature spacious bathrooms with extra-wide shower heads and comfortable chairs.

The upper-floor Fullerton Suite opens to a backyard-like terrace, while the exquisitely-furnished Presidential Suite has its own glass-enclosed veranda beneath the Doric columns. Plush bedding and free Wi-Fi for all rooms.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
Five restaurants please global palates. Appropriately named, the Lighthouse Restaurant and Rooftop Bar was once a working lighthouse but now specialises in Italian fare including Trittico Della Baia (34 Singapore Dollars/£19) an antipasti seafood trio of citrus tuna tartare, marinated red prawn and giant scallop with crispy bacon. Taste dim sum specialties like sautéed Wagyu beef with garlic and black pepper sauce (36 Singapore Dollars, £20) in Jade, which offers creative Cantonese dishes.

The buffet spread at Town Restaurant gives new meaning to power breakfast, while the contemporary Post Bar pays homage to the hotel's previous life as the General Post Office. Light fare in the lobby Courtyard, while the concierge-level Straits Club offers complimentary champagne breakfast, afternoon teas and daily buffets.  

Value for Money: 9 / 10
Double rooms from 409 Singapore Dollars (£229) in low season; and from 845 Singapore Dollars (£474) in high. Suites from 648 Singapore Dollars (£363) in low season; and from 1,433 Singapore Dollars (£803) in high. Free Wi-Fi. Competitive prices for expensive Singapore.

2) Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel
With its octagonal, green-tiled pagoda roof, Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel has been an architectural icon in Orchard Road since the property started life as Dynasty Hotel in 1982. With shopping, dining and entertainment at its doorstop, it is arguably Singapore’s best-situated hotel.

Location: 10 / 10
Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel has the most enviable location of all hotel properties in the prime Orchard Road district. It is situated no more than five minutes away from the Orchard MRT station via a linked underground walkway and right next to local fashion retail icon, Tangs at Tang Plaza.

All of the city’s prime shopping malls – including ION Orchard, Ngee Ann City shopping centre and Paragon – are accessible on foot while the Raffles MRT station in the Central Business District is just four stops away by train. To top it off, two of Singapore’s top medical facilities - Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Paragon Medical - are just five minutes away on foot. As far as location goes, you can get any better than this.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
The 30-storey property still looks as grand as it did when it first opened as Dynasty Hotel in 1982, then as Marriott Singapore in 1995, thanks in part to the constant refurbishments which keep the public spaces looking current. The marble clad lobby boasts a lofty, three storey-high ceiling framed by towering off-white pillars and topped with a glass-tipped air well. You won’t have to jostle with other hotel guests even if there’s a crowd.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
While there isn’t a tennis court here, there are enough facilities – including The Retreat spa, a gym, a swimming pool and a half-size basketball court – to keep you busy if shopping is not on your agenda. Service is as courteous and professional as can be. Calls to the housekeeping department and front desk were attended to promptly.

Rooms: 8 / 10
There are 392 rooms in 10 categories ranging from Deluxe to Suites. The Deluxe rooms, which occupy the fifth to 14th storeys, are spacious at 36 square metres, and come in a neutral palette with wood-panelled walls, Marriott’s signature 'Revive' bedding (box-spring mattress, 300-thread-count cotton sheets), a marble-top study desk and a 1956 leather Eames desk chair. Book the Junior Suite if you want separate living and sleeping spaces, and the Pool Terrace room for convenient swim access.

Incidentally, only the Junior Suite and Pool Terrace rooms come with a bathtub. All rooms are equipped with Thann’s range of bath amenities but only rooms in the Executive Room category and upwards have Nespresso coffee machines. Guests of the Executive Room and above also have access to the recently updated Executive Lounge on the 27th floor, which serves complimentary continental breakfast and evening cocktails.

Food and Drink: 9 / 10
The Michelin-starred Singapore offshoot of Ginza Sushi Ichi offers edomae-style sushi via an array of set meals and omakase courses, including a great value lunch omakase (SGD 240/£136) that offers eight courses of nigiri sushi, including bincho-torched tuna cheek sushi as well as a rice course of Hokkaido hairy crab tossed with raw sea urchin and ikura pearls.

There's also Wan Hao for well-prepared Cantonese classics (the lobster with poached rice and puffed rice in lobster broth is a must-try, as is the braised bird’s nest with crab meat and egg white served alongside a cup of superior broth. Marriott Café, an all-day diner, also serves an international buffet breakfast spread that includes dim sum, noodles, a good selection of pastries (the croissants are excellent), juices, salads, ice cream and an egg station offering chilli crab omelette.

For evening drinks, don't miss The Other Room, a Prohibition-style bar with an unmarked entrance by the lobby that serves spirits finished in-house, available as tasting flights or as a base in cocktails like the smoke-finished Reversed Gin & Tonic. If you visit from 6pm to 8.30pm from Sundays to Thursdays, your beverage will be served with a complimentary plate of nduja toast.

Value for Money: 7 / 10
Double rooms from SGD 330 (£186) in low season; and from SGD 550 (£311) in high. Breakfast not inlcuded, costs SGD 42 (£24); included for rooms with Executive Lounge access. Free Wi-Fi.
Access for guests with disabilities?
Two adapted rooms with doors that open automatically and reduced-height light switches.

Family-Friendly?
All dining outlets have children’s menus and child-friendly utensils. Cots and interconnecting rooms available upon request free of charge.

3) Marina Bay Sands
Developed at a cost of $8 billion Singapore Dollars, the triple-towered, 55-storey Moshe Safdie-designed mega property fronting the Marina Bay is reportedly the most expensive stand-alone integrated resort property ever built.

Location: 9 / 10
MBS' location is unrivalled. The Bayfront MRT is located at Marina Bay Sands and connects directly to the Hotel, The Shoppes, Expo, Convention Centre and Gardens by the Bay. The Central Business District is just 10 minutes away by taxi but if you prefer to catch a train, the Raffles Place MRT is just two stops from Bayfront MRT.

Orchard Road can be accessed by taxi (15 to 20 minutes) or by MRT (Orchard MRT is four more stops after Raffles Place MRT). Bayfront MRT is connected to both the Circle and Downtown line.

Style and Character: 7 / 10
Befitting the sheer scale of the mammoth development, the 23 storey-high hotel atrium is expansive, bookended by the check-in counters (near Tower 1) on one end and and the Ce La Vi Skypark access counter (near Tower 3) on the other.

Tower 1 features the reception booth for LAVO, an Italian restaurant and rooftop bar atop the Sands SkyPark, and Renku, an Asian-inspired hotel bar and lounge. The soaring ceiling and generous use of glass casts the lobby in natural light creating a breezy feel. However, don’t expect peace and quiet here, particularly on weekends when hoards of hotel guests and dining patrons throng the space.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
From the much-talked-about 57th floor infinity pool, the sprawling Banyan Tree Spa and Fitness Club, to the three levels of gaming floor space and more than 270 retail stores at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, there is something to keep everyone occupied.

Hotel guests enjoy exclusive, complimentary access to the Banyan Tree Fitness Club as well as personal training sessions (chargeable) and daily sunrise yoga lessons. Even if the property seems to be perpetually crowded, the well-trained service staff did not seem harried or stressed. Our request for bottled water and bath amenities were promptly attended to.

Rooms: 9 / 10
The 2,561 minimally embellished rooms are each adorned with floor-to-ceiling windows, a 42” interactive flat-screen television, thick carpets, textured wallpaper and luxurious wood and marble furnishings, with all rooms bearing a palette of earthy tones. The lead-in Deluxe rooms come with a choice of views of Gardens by the Bay (with the Avatar-esque supertrees as a stunning key feature), Harbour (Marina Bay Promenade) or the City (Central Business District).

For added space to accommodate families of up to four, book a Family Room. While these rooms do not come with great views (by virtue of their location on the second and third floors) they come with an airy space, a king-size bed plus twin beds, a spacious balcony and a nespresso machine, plus free Wi-Fi and house-brand bath amenities.

Suite guests are pampered with Roberto Cavalli bath amenities and have all-day access to the gargantuan Club55 Lounge for buffet breakfast and all-day beverages.

Food and Drink: 9 / 10
There are more than 80 dining options, including nine celebrity chef restaurants: Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay, Bistro and Oyster Bar by Daniel Boulud, Long Chim by David Thompson, Osteria & Pizzeria Mozza by Nancy Silverton, Spago by Wolfgang Park, as well as the two-Michelin starred Waku Ghin by Tetsuya Wakuda and the one-Michelin starred CUT by Wolfgang Puck.

If you don’t mind a dent in your bank account, make a reservation at CUT for some of Singapore’s best steaks (try the highly marbled Hokkaido Snow Beef) or Waku Ghin for Wakuda’s toothsome Japanese inspired French multi-course tasting menu. For weekend brunch, options are plentiful in the property but you should not miss Sunday Roast at Ramsay’s très chic Bread Street Kitchen.

By night, the restaurant’s upper decks opens out into the waterfront for al fresco dining (the roasted black cod with capers and artichoke is to-die-for). A relatively new and note-worthy concept is Adrift by David Myers, where Izakaya meets Californian techniques and a melange of Japanese and European ingredients in first rate dishes like Japanese flying squid with squid ink vinaigrette scented with brown butter as well as glazed ox tongue scented with sudachi apple, pink peppercorns and sesame soy.

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Room rates start at 369 Singapore dollars (£200) per room per night. This includes complimentary Wi-Fi but not buffet breakfast, which can be had at Spago or Rise for 45 Singapore dollars. Suites guests have buffet breakfast at Club55 included in the room rate.

Access for guests with disabilities?
Guests with disabilities can access every part of the property including Sands SkyPark, either through lifts or wheelchair ramps. There are also 15 wheelchair accessible rooms and 56 elderly-friendly rooms that are equipped with modified toilet fittings to ensure ease of use such as grab bars mounted on the walls. Marina Bay Sands was also the Official Games Village for the eighth ASEAN Para Games.

Family-Friendly?
Marina Bay Sands offers 13 Family Rooms for families of four. Amenities and services provided include baby cots, portable bath tubs and kid-sized bathrobe and slippers.

From the ArtScience museum, theatre performances to the skating rink, children are spoilt for choice at Marina Bay Sands although, admittedly, these are all paid entertainment. An exception is Family Friday, where children under 12 are offered complimentary access to exhibits held at the museum with the aim of promoting quality family bonding.

4) Shangri-La Hotel Singapore
After decades in business as Shangri-La's maiden property, this gorgeous grand dame of luxury continues to deliver.

Location: 8 / 10
The 792-room Shangri-La is buried within a leafy, tropical paradise that spans six hectares (15 acres) of beautifully manicured gardens smack bang in a high-class residential estate that fringes Orchard Road. Yet, the Orchard and Stevens MRT stations, and the surrounding glitzy malls, are no more than 15-minutes away on foot. The Central Business District is a short taxi ride away. Shangri-La feels so remote and yet so central.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
The hotel is made up of three towers. The Tower Wing exudes a contemporary design with a subtle Asian touch; the Garden Wing is a resort-like oasis; and the Valley Wing offers classic elegance. A recent facelift to the Tower Wing has breathed new life into Shangri-La Singapore’s voluminous lobby. While retaining its towering ceiling of cathedral-like proportions, the colonnaded lobby now sports an eye-catching Tree Canopy art installation featuring metallic leaves festooned from the ceiling by Japanese designer, Hirotoshi Sawada. Adjacent to this is a gigantic silkscreen tapestry depicting raindrops, which forms the backdrop to the grandiose check-in area. 

Over the years, the property’s lush tropical gardens has amassed a collection of more than 133,000 types of ornamental flowering trees, fruit trees, aquatic plants, tropical flowers and Asian herbs. Not to mention the seven-metre-tall, open-air orchid greenhouse sculpture that was erected on the grounds of the hotel. It's certainly befitting of its status as the city’s 'second' Botanical Gardens.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
Apart from a 24-hour gym, four floodlit tennis courts (that come complete with racquets, balls and apparel to loan)and a free-form swimming pool, the hotel also offers a wood-decked, seven-treatment-room CHI Spa with results-oriented Biologique Recherche facials and an array of soothing body massage treatments. The hotel staff, about 10 per cent of whom are long-standing employees, are trained to please dignitaries and celebrities; but the same poised, sharp and impeccable service is extended to all guests. If we had to pick the happiest hotel staff in Singapore, it would be Shangri-La’s.

Rooms: 9 / 10
Rooms are available are across the three wings. Leisure travellers tend to go for the rattan and wood-decked Garden Wing rooms with private balconies overlooking either the swimming pool or the city; heads of states – and those with deep pockets – are ushered to the ultra-exclusive Valley Wing, which comes with elegant rooms, its own driveway, complimentary breakfast as well as unlimited champagne, wine and canapés in its lounge. Otherwise, head for the Tower Wing, which recently emerged with 503 revamped rooms. 

All rooms come with a Nespresso coffee machine and marble bathrooms, but only specific room categories (the Grand Premier room, the one-bedroom Suite and Grand Suite) offer a kitchenette with an induction stove. Guests who book the Horizon Club rooms on levels 20 to 23 or suites (in the Tower Wing) all have access to the airy Horizon Club Lounge on the 24th storey of the property. Apart from panoramic city views, there is a choice of hot and cold beverages (including soya milk, almond milk and rice milk) all day, plus complimentary meals including a generous breakfast spread, afternoon tea (think scones and foie gras sliders) as well as DIY cocktails and canapés in the evenings. 

Food and Drink: 9 / 10
The Line remains popular for its breakfast buffet, and Shang Palace for its Cantonese fare, but don't miss the hotel's newer dining concepts. The towering Lobby Lounge serves a Peranakan-inspired buffet to go with hawker fare prepared with recipes and sauces purchased from local markets (try the laksa by Katong Laksa, "bak chor mee" from Seng Kee, prawn noodle soup by Beach Road Prawn Mee and chilli crabs in deep-fried buns by Dragon Phoenix).

Nami, on the 24th storey of the Tower Wing, serves sushi, sashimi and omakase by former Nadaman Tokyo veteran, chef Shigeo Akiba, who prides himself on dashi-based dishes like hamo (pike conger eel) stuffed with uni with Japanese pickling melon and junsai (watershield). The Waterfall serves an extensive range of reasonably prices pastas and pizzas.

Instead of jostling with the public at The Line for breakfast, we recommend guests pay for the entry-level Horizon Club rooms for access to the excellent breakfast at the Horizon Club Lounge – think fresh fruits, pastries, Beurre D'Isigny butter as well as a decent hot food buffet including eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, nasi lemak and plain porridge.

Value for Money: 7 / 10
Room rates in the Tower Wing start from SGD 420 (£239) on weekdays (Sun-Thurs); and from SGD380 (£216) on weekends (Fri-Sat); both prices exclude breakfast. Horizon Club rooms start at SGD 470 (£267). Wi-fi is included in the room rate but unless you book the Horizon Club, Valley Wing Deluxe rooms or suites, room rates do not include breakfast (the buffet costs SGD 43/£24 per person). 

Access for guests with disabilities?
The Tower Wing offers six accessible rooms, while the Garden Wing and Valley Wing offer three and one respectively.

Family-Friendly?
When its integrated children’s amenities roll out in December 2017, Shangri-La will have specific child-friendly amenities, including a VIB (Very Important Baby programme), a dedicated family floor with 19 Family Deluxe rooms and five themed family suites (pick from Castle, Underwater, Treetop, Safari and Space), as well as an indoor kids’ club.

22 Orange Grove Road, Singapore, 258350.

5) Raffles Singapore
Singapore’s grand dame recently emerged from a two-year facelift. She's looking sharper and spiffier than before, while still retaining the colonial-era splendour that she's known for. The 1887 property is one of the city-state's most historic and iconic, as it's named after Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore. 

Location: 9 / 10
Raffles Singapore sits on the original plot of 10 bungalows at Beach Road that once overlooked  sandy beaches and azure skies. However, with Singapore’s rapid development and land reclamation efforts, the hotel’s sea-facing view has been replaced with a view of the bustling malls in the heart of the city. It takes no more than five minutes to walk to City Hall MRT, Raffles City Shopping Centre and JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach. Both the Esplanade MRT station and newly renovated Funan mall are also just a 10-minute walk away.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
“Raffles Hotel stands for all the fables of the exotic East”, Somerset Maugham, a playwright, once wrote. Stepping into the grand lobby, one imagines that it could be a reverie of Singapore’s colonial past: every fixture, installation and detail, including the liveried Sikh doormen, is meant to enhance the hotel’s old world splendour. The gravel driveway is reminiscent of an era past, when horse-drawn carriages once chauffeured the hotel’s guests. And the antique grandfather clock, one of the hotel’s oldest pieces of furniture, stands as a testament to Raffles Hotel’s status as a National Monument.

What’s new is the mammoth bohemian chandelier, from the Czech Republic, that glistens with 8,214 pieces of crystals, hung from the skylight roof in the three-storey-high lobby, a centrepiece that draws attention without detracting from the quiet opulence of its neo-Renaissance style.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
I stress-tested the butler service (available to every room) by requesting a Singapore Sling (the iconic pineapple juice cocktail that was developed by a Long Bar bartender before 1915, served as a welcome drink to all guests), followed by tea, bottled water, and, finally, a duvet – and I was greeted with a smile and a keen sense of efficiency every single time. For shopping, you can’t go wrong with the swanky shops at the Raffles Arcade, but to beat jet lag, you are better off visiting the seven treatment-room resident spa. Located in the Raffles Arcade, this cutting edge spa offers an array of body treatments and customised facials using products from Ormonde Jayne. There's also a rooftop swimming pool. 

Rooms: 10 / 10
There are 115 suites, the lead-in category being the Studio Suites (46 square metres). Like its name suggests, they are structured like a studio apartment and not unlike your typical city hotel rooms.

For the signature Raffles experience, I recommend that you go for a State Room Suite (67 square metres) in the historic Bras Basah Wing, or a Palm Court Suite (70 square metres) overlooking the Palm Court instead. Both suite types come with a three-part layout – a parlour for living and dining; an airy bedroom with ceiling fan, teak wood flooring and a dressing table; and a luxurious Bianco Dolomite marble-clad double vanity bathroom with a tub and separate stalls for a shower and toilet. Both types also have outdoor verandas with rattan seats.

All suites come with a Nespresso coffee machine, complimentary non-alcoholic mini bar (hidden in a trunk-inspred cabinet) and bath amenities by Ormonde Jayne. A butler is attached to each suite and s/he is on-call 24/7 to help guests pack or unpack, serve coffee, tea or cocktails, and make spa reservations. 

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
For breakfast, you won’t want to miss one of the finest morning spreads in town at Tiffin Room: a continental offering of smoked meats, fresh fruits, fresh-pressed juices (try the beetroot) and baked goods such as quiches, tarts and cronuts, matched with your pick from the à la carte menu, such as nasi lemak (a Malaysian rice dish), a Japanese bento box or an omelette, amongst other options. By night, Tiffin Road morphs into an Indian restaurant that serves most of its dishes in gilded tiffin trays. Try the signature Mera Dabba set where you pick two mains, like the so-so tandoori chicken or the delicious medley of vegetables to go with (somewhat chewy) naans, excellent basmati rice and buttery dahl.

If you have time for only one indulgence, I recommend a reservation at La Dame de Pic, an offshoot of the three Michelin-starred restaurant by the maestro Anne-Sophie Pic. This fine-diner offers a selection of three tasting menus, each featuring the chef’s riveting signature of berlingots, pyramid-shaped, cheese-wrapped pasta parcels, served with green zebra tomatoes in a pungent herb of grace consommé fragranced with verbena. The elegant dining room rivals the dish as the talking point: think soft pink and rich plum with gray and metalic accents in a space illuminated by a gold chandelier.

If you are thirsty for a digestive, consider skipping the tourist-filled Long Bar and head over to the Writers Bar for a cocktail - the current menu is inspired by Writer-in-Residence Pico Iyer and features a handful of swizzles like “Escape to Home” perfumed with laksa leaf and cucumber.

Value for Money: 6 / 10
State Room Suites from S$836 (£546), including 24-hour butler service. Breakfast ist S$72 (£50) per adult. Free Wi-Fi. 

Access for guests with disabilities?
There are two accessible suites in the Courtyard wing that are wheelchair-friendly with bathrooms fitted with grab bars. One suite has a king bed and the other a twin set-up. 
Family-Friendly?
The 24-hour butler service allows families to arrange baby-sitting services. There are in-suite video games and child-friendly activities available around the hotel. At turn down, specially created children’s stories adapted from the hotel’s history are placed in suites with families.

6) Swissotel The Stamford
The I.M.Pei-designed Swissotel the Stamford Singapore, one of South East Asia’s tallest hotels, remains one of the city's most desirable addresses for its panoramic views, excellent facilities and unrivalled access to Singapore’s shops and restaurants.

Location: 9 / 10
Swissotel Singapore’s location can’t be beaten. Located by the F1 track, atop City Hall MRT Station, part of the Raffles City complex that also comprises Fairmont Singapore and Raffles City shopping centre. It’s connected to Suntec City, Marina Square, Esplanade Theatres and Esplanade MRT station by the subterranean CityLink Mall. The Orchard MRT station is just three stops away by train, Marina Bay Sands a mere five-minute taxi and 20 minutes to Changi Airport.

Style and Character: 7 / 10
After 30 years in business, first as Westin the Stamford and then as Swissotel the Stamford, this property may appear to be losing some of its shine to swish new lodgings, and truth be told, some of the furnishings in the public spaces are indeed looking a tad dated. Given its extremely central location, you will find the colonnaded hotel lobby flooded with people at any time of the day. Despite this, the well-maintained property remains spick and span.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
Befitting the sheer scale of the hotel, the facilities here are impressive - a Willow Stream Spa, six tennis courts, two free-form swimming pools, a state of the art fitness centre as well as a smaller Amrita gym for the use of guests of the Stamford Crest suites. The service team seems eager to please although cracks appears when they get too busy (instead of facilitating our request for a mobile phone charger, the front desk officer asked that we place a separate call to the concierge).

Rooms: 8 / 10
There are 1,261 rooms and suites (six categories of rooms and two categories of suites) spread over 73 storeys offering views of either the city - which are truly mesmerising - the harbour or the pool. The lead-in classic room is spacious and comes with a wooden headboard adorned with local artwork, floor-to-ceiling glass windows affording panoramic views and essential oil-infused Pürovel bath amenities.

For added space and a touch of luxury, book the Stamford Crest suite. Located on the upper floors, the suites are one of the most elegant we've seen and comes with separate sleeping/living quarters. Lovely touches include an electricity-powered essential oil burner as well as complimentary access to the Living Room on the 65th floor for breakfast and evening snacks. Nespresso coffee machines are available in all suites and two room categories (Executive Club room and Swiss Advantage room).  

Food and Drink: 9 / 10
The sheer diversity and array of dining options within the property is mind-boggling. One Michelin-starred Jaan situated on the 70th floor serves a trio of seasonally changing modern French tasting menus (priced from S$198/£113 for five courses) by chef Kirk Westaway featuring dishes like the young British chef’s take on heirloom tomato.

Ground floor Prego, by chef Antonio Facchinetti, serves pan Italian cuisine headlined by a parade of rare fresh pasta like pizzoccheri, a buckwheat pasta with broccolini, potatoes, bitto cheese and butter sage sauce (S$36/£21) as well as strozzapreti pasta with braised ragu, pecorino romano and shaved fresh fennel (S$34/£19).

For local fare, Kopi Tiam fields local favourites like chilli crabs and laksa and Cafe Swiss serves an all-day buffet including an extensive breakfast spread featuring a selection of sausages (the café tends to be packed on weekends, come before 9am).

Value for Money: 9 / 10
Double rooms from £145 (S$255) in low season; and from £210 (S$370) in high season, excluding breakfast (£20/S$35). Free Wi-Fi.

Access for guests with disabilities?
There are five Classic rooms available for guests with disabilities that are fitted with bathroom railings and lower peepholes.

Family-Friendly?
Families with kids (aged 12 and below) will be greeted with a special room setup with kids size bathrobes and slippers. A children’s menu is available for in-room dining and at Prego. Baby cots are available upon request and do not cost extra.

7) The Warehouse Hotel
With a storied past and a strategic location by the banks of the Singapore River, this sleek boutique hotel offers a Singapore experience like no other.

Location: 8 / 10
The Warehouse Hotel is situated on the banks of the Singapore River, right opposite the bustling Robertson Quay food and drink enclave. The nearest Clarke Quay MRT station is a good 20-minute walk away. If you’re heading to the financial district, catch a cab – it will take you no more than five to 10 minutes to get to your destination. A cab ride to Orchard Road takes about 10 to 15 minutes.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
Once a spice warehouse, then the Warehouse Disco and finally an oil mill, this historic 1895 building has been transformed into a 37-room boutique hotel after a 22 month-long renovation. The lofty hotel lobby sports a sleek industrial design with intricate details that whisper of the property’s past. The double-volume ceiling festooned with custom lightings inspired by pulleys found in godowns illuminate the space, while a feature wall in exposed brick harks back to the building’s heritage past.

There is no lack of designer details, such as plush leather seats from renowned brands (think Jess Design from Belgium and Stellar Works from Australia). The chic factor is toned down a tad at the on-site restaurant, Po, that strives to reflect on the city’s historical 'kampong' (Malay village) spirit with the generous use of rattan seats,crystal beaded lamps and terrazzo floor tiles.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
Apart from the swimming pool, there isn't much in terms facilities – not that you'll need them. Built over an added extension, the positively pink-tiled cantilevered pool offers a meditative respite from the bustle of the city. Service by the young crew is aptly polished and quietly professional. Our multiple requests for bottled water, for example, were promptly attended to.

Rooms: 9 / 10
There are 37 rooms in six categories, spread over two stories. If you like your digs with a voluminous ceiling, book a room on the upper floor. And if you prefer not to have a windowless room, the Sanctuary rooms are not for you.

While all rooms have a different layout, they are decked in a uniformed theme of taupe and grey muted tones against green forest marble, wooden floors and black metal-framed frosted or see-through bathroom doors with original masonry walls. To draw attention to its unique made-in-Singapore theme, in-room coffee and tea mugs are custom-made by a local ceramic studio while locally made bedspreads proudly showcase the hotel's silhouette in ikat patterned textile. Complimentary drip coffee bags and teabags are custom-packed for the hotel by local companies (we love the coffee by Papa Palheta) while minibar snacks, which are chargeable, include a specially curated range of Asian snacks including Vietnamese dark chocolate.

To play its part for the environment, filtered water is served in refillable glass bottles rather than plasti, while refillable bath toiletries are by Ashley & Co New Zealand (it’s amazingly aromatic). Despite its proximity to Havelock Road, the excellent in-room soundproofing ensures zero noise pollution.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
The lobby bar, which gets busy in the evenings, offers a cocktail menu that reflects on different chapters of the property's history. Po, meaning grandmother in Mandarin, serves elevated Singaporean classics such as the do-it-yourself popiah with handpicked flower crabs, raw local barramundi iceberg salad in a calamansi chilli dressing, chunky charcoal-grilled iberico pork satay and carabinero prawns on kombu mee. At breakfast, it serves a limited continental spread of freshly baked pastries, cheeses and homemade granola matched with your choice of hot food (try the classic Singapore congee or the hearty English breakfast). If you prefer to eat out, take a short stroll to the nearby Robertson Quay where food and drink options abound.

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Sanctuary rooms from S$345 (£198); Warehouse Loft rooms from S$369 (£211), inclusive of taxes. Wi-Fi is included but breakfast is not (S$39/£22 per person for adults; S$25/£14 for children between eight and 12 years old).

8) InterContinental Singapore
The InterContinental Singapore may not be blessed with the harbourfront views of its Hong Kong flagship, but the recently refreshed Straits Chinese-inspired public spaces, plus the refurbished rooms with Peranakan undertones in the Main Tower, are a huge draw. 

Location: 9 / 10
Sited at one of the city’s most desirable addresses, the hotel is linked to the Bugis MRT station through the Bugis Junction shopping centre. From here, a train ride to the financial district or Orchard Road takes just minutes

Style and Character: 9 / 10
Drawing from its location in the Bugis district, an area that once teemed with Peranakan (Straits Chinese) shop houses, the InterContinental Singapore was built with the Peranakans in mind – think ornate wood carvings, wooden louvred windows and an abundant display of Peranakan ornaments such as food containers with traditional prints of phoenixes and peonies, porcelain pillows and an antique basin stand.

Fashioned after the living room of a Peranakan household, the Concierge Lounge showcases a focal art piece that features a mix of local characters from all walks of life, recalling the glory days of the site where the hotel now sits. The hotel’s Peranakan heritage is best felt in the rows of 1920s shop houses that have been cleverly incorporated into the design of the rooms in the Heritage wing.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
As expected of an InterContinental, the service staff are poised and experienced. The hotel has almost all the requisite facilities of a city hotel except a spa. The 24-hour Fitness Centre is particularly spacious and comes with a Yoga Quiet Room.

The hotel hosts a complimentary two-hour Guide Heritage Trail of the neighbourhood. Conducted every Saturday afternoon, the tour explores cultural enclaves including Arab Street and Kampong Glam as well as the nearby Waterloo and Albert Streets.

Rooms: 8 / 10
The 403 rooms and suites come in two categories: 338 are in the 16-floor Main Tower; a further 65 in the Heritage Wing. We highly recommend the rooms and suites in the Main Tower that re-opened in 2016 after an extensive renovation.

The lead-in Deluxe Rooms in the Main Tower blend Peranakan undertones (wooden-framed beds with leather paddings, silk-padded wall panels block-printed with Peranakan tile motifs and new duck egg-blue carpets with motifs that take its cues from the phoenix) with a contemporary design that emphasises luxury.

From the Heritage Wing, which was not renovated, the lowest-category Heritage Rooms come with the same wooden-framed beds with leather paddings, timber flooring, lush fabrics as well as traditional shop house window shutters. While the rooms in the Heritage Wing remain well maintained, the carpets in the corridors are looking worn and dated.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
Even with many food & beverage options in the neighbourhood, the hotel stands tall with its food and beverage offerings. Ash & Elm is the hotel’s pride and joy: a European-centric all-day diner with a charcuterie and cheese room, a wood-fired oven and a charcoal-grill kitchen that serves buffet breakfast by day (watch out for the stellar Indian corner), a semi buffet lunch by lunch and an à la carte dinner featuring dishes like burrata with heirloom tomatoes, charcoal grilled steaks and pastas.

Man Fu Yuan serves toothsome Cantonese cuisine headlined by dim sum and Peking duck while the Lobby Lounge is where locals and hotel guests alike sit down for a thematic afternoon tea (currently featuring the Citrus Collection). Additionally, the hotel is also home to Chikuyotei, a Japanese fine-dining restaurant, as well as Baker & Cook, an artisan bakery.  

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Room rates in the Main Tower start from 412 Singapore dollars (£223). Hotel rates are inclusive of Wi-Fi only. Breakfast at Ash & Elm is available at 35 Singapore dollars (£19) per person.

You can stretch your money by signing up for Club InterContinental access (an additional 165 Singapore dollars/£89 per person, per night), which gives you breakfast, afternoon tea, evening cocktails, three pieces of complimentary ironing and a free flow of coffee, tea and bottled water. You even get an hour’s use of a private boardroom – perfect for business guests who need to make an impression.

Access for guests with disabilities?
Yes. There are two wheelchair-accessible rooms in the hotel.

Family-Friendly?
InterContinental’s clientele is made up of 60 per cent corporate guests but children are welcomed. In-room dining caters to the little ones with a special menu.

9) JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach
Housed in a mega retail, office, hotel and residential complex, JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, formerly known as The South Beach, offers 634 rooms and suites in a pair of shimmering glass and steel towers, with architecture by Foster + Partners as well as Aedas, and interior design by Philippe Starck.

Location: 8 / 10
Located on Beach Road, right across the road from Raffles Hotel, the hotel is easily accessed by the Esplanade MRT as well as the City Hall MRT, both about five to eight minutes' walk from the hotel. The financial district is just one train stop away from City Hall MRT station and Marina Bay Sands two stops away from the Esplanade MRT station. Orchard Road is accessed by cab (10 minutes) or MRT (via City Hall MRT). The hotel also connects to the Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre via an aero-bridge.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
The centrepiece of this Philippe Stark-designed mega hotel complex is the lobby, an elongated space with a painted concrete floor, towering ceiling festooned with light fixtures (look out for the stunning light installation of 160 floating candles with LED flames), vibrant colours, designer – and sometimes eccentric – furniture pieces and art installations, all highlighted by a floor-to-ceiling video installation by Korean artist, Lee Lee Nam.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
There is a six treatment room spa in the East Tower and two sky gardens; Flow 18 is perched on the 18th floor of the main tower, while Ebb 6 is on the top floor of the East Tower. Both come with an infinity pool but the former also offers panoramic views plus recreational facilities including tables for billiard and table tennis. If you’re looking to burn off some calories, hit the gym or jog the one-kilometre trail around the property. Service is as polished as can be and all our telephone requests for water and towels were promptly delivered.

Rooms: 9 / 10
There are four categories of room, starting from the lead-in Deluxe, plus a further four categories of suites. All offer views of the Padang, Suntec City or Raffles Hotel, are spacious (starting from 430 square feet) and decked out in a neutral palette with pristine white leather headboards, lots of mirrors and chrome, plus all have the seminal Philippe Starck-designed chrome rocking chair (suites have the French-styled yellow salon chairs). The majority of the generously sized bathrooms come with Starck-designed matt tubs and a separate WC and shower. None of the rooms or suites provides coffee-making facilities.

Rooms from Club Deluxe onwards have complimentary access to the enormous Executive Lounge on the second floor, which offers refreshments all day long, as well as breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening. Female guests seeking privacy may book the women’s only floor, which come with an additional security door as well as added features like facial steamers and hair straighteners in rooms.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
There are three bars and two restaurants. Beach Road Kitchen is an all-day diner that opens for breakfast through to dinner; the dinner buffet is noteworthy for the grilled-to-order fish from France and the Mediterranean, foie gras on toast with fig compote and freshly shucked Fine de Claire oysters. Akira Back, on the other hand, serves Korean-accented Japanese cuisine.

In terms of the bars, Media is notable is for its quirky counter built with 24 TV screens; Tonic is an intimate gin-focused lobby bar; and Court Martial serves sophisticated cocktails with a twist.
Value for Money7 / 10
450 Singapore dollars (£210) per room, per night, excluding taxes. Free Wi-Fi, local calls and minibar. 

Access for guests with disabilities?
The hotel provides four accessible room with grab bars.

Family-Friendly?

10) Four Seasons Hotel Singapore
The long-standing Four Seasons Hotel Singapore brings a touch of nature to the heart of Singapore’s shopping belt with its botanical-inspired rooms. Be sure to book for Michelin-starred restaurant Jiang Nan Chun, which serves classic Cantonese dishes. 

Location: 8 / 10
Located in Singapore’s main shopping belt of Orchard Road, the hotel is a seven-minute walk from the Orchard MRT station, and a stone’s throw from nearby malls like the Wheelock Place and Forum Galleria. Hilton Singapore is connected to the hotel via an air-conditioned walkway dotted with boutiques. The Singapore Botanic Gardens is also close by, although getting there on foot would take close to 15 to 20 minutes.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
Under the direction of renowned floral designer, Nicolai Bergmann, guests entering Four Seasons Hotel Singapore are greeted with gigantic fresh floral display at the decidedly grand lobby, perhaps a reflection of the nearby Singapore Botanic Gardens from which it draws inspiration. Overall, it's a class act, its design understated and never ostentatious.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
There are two swimming pools: a lap pool available to guests above 12 years of age on level three, and a family pool on the rooftop. A 24-hour gym, in addition to indoor and outdoor tennis courts, is also available. To beat jetlag, I highly recommend the 90-minute Néroli & Orchidée treatment (body scrub and massage using L’Occitane) at the spa – ask for the ultra-skilled Thai masseur. Service is warm and prompt.

Rooms:9 / 10
Rooms feature botanical flourishes in an earthy and neutral palette. At 49 square metres, the entry-level Deluxe rooms are spacious and elegant (look out for the feature wall with Peranakan tiles), each offering a bathtub, double bathroom vanities and amenities by L’Occitane. Beds have adjustable firmness and there's a pillow menu. 

For added space, comfort and luxury, you can’t beat the suites. The entry-level Royal Suite is a staggering 155 square metres and comes with a spacious bedroom with a work desk and a dressing table, a living room with an enormous sofa, a dining room big enough for eight and a kitchenette (with a fridge and a coffee machine). Bath amenities are  by Eau Impériale, Guerlain. All rooms and suites come with a Lavazza coffee machine and big windows offering either greenery or city views.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
It’s worth noting that the resident Chinese restaurant, Jiang Nan Chun, has a Michelin star and serves a classic Cantonese menu ranging from the hugely popular Peking duck to dishes as simple and heart-warming as seafood fried rice with butterscotch mushrooms in abalone sauce. You’re in luck if you visit during the Mooncake festival as they also sell an excellent assorted nuts with smoked duck mooncake.

One-Ninety is the all-day diner that serves an East-meets-West buffet at breakfast, and an à la carte menu of modern European and local fare thereafter. Your best bet for an aperitif – or digestif – without stepping out of the hotel is One-Ninety Bar (try the aromatic gin and tonic spiked with sweet vermouth).

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Deluxe rooms from £180, excluding breakfast (£20 per person). Free Wi-Fi.

Access for guests with disabilities?
The hotel has two wheelchair-accessible Deluxe rooms, with accessible shower stalls and grab bars in the bathroom.

Family-Friendly?
The hotel is extremely family-friendly - bedroom slippers are provided in different sizes (including children's sizes) and One-Ninety Restaurant offers a kids’ corner at the breakfast buffet. The hotel also has a Kids for All Seasons club and babysitting services, and all children under the age of four dine for free. Complimentary rollaway beds can also be provided for children under 18.

11) Six Senses Maxwell
This hotel, the bigger Singapore sibling of Six Senses Duxton, takes on luxury with European design flourishes, unique local accents and interior designer Jacques Garcia's trademark style of flamboyance. Don't forget to visit the Maxwell Food Centre (across the road) for some of Singapore's best chicken rice stalls. 

Location: 8 / 10
Six Senses Maxwell is set in a row of 14 three- and four-storey colonial-style heritage houses which were built in 1929. Like its stable mate, it is located in the Tanjong Pagar district, with the Tanjong Pagar MRT station about an eight-minute walk away. The iconic Maxwell Food Centre is right across the road from the hotel (accessed via Murray Terrace Brasserie). Access to the Central Business District is quick, either by taxi (five minutes ride to Raffles Place) or by MRT (Raffles Place MRT station is one stop away). The Orchard Road shopping belt is no more than a 10-minute taxi ride away.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
The hotel's Art Deco façade of exposed brickwork, with original lion head rain spouts and a flagpole, barely hint of the sumptuous interiors by interior designer Jacques Garcia. Providing a welcomed contrast from the opulence-drenched interiors of its Duxton Road sibling, Six Senses Maxwell is mostly grounded in elegant European aesthetics: think chestnut wood-framed reception and hand-woven silk rugs blanketing the African wenge hardwood floor in the lobby, with the occasional injection of Garcia's flamboyant tasseled high-backed velvet chairs and lamps with pleated silk lampshades dotted throughout the property. Elsewhere in its public spaces, you will find recycled stone floors salvaged from Italian medieval churches and cathedrals while brass plaque-framed original indentures adorn the hotel's doorway on the second and third floors. 

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
What sets Six Senses Maxwell apart from the crowd is its attention to guest experiences – as well as a welcome drink at check-in, all hotel guests also get complimentary scoops of ice cream served from a cart. Suite guests also receive vouchers to redeem for a cup of Chinese tea at a nearby teahouse. We have no complaints with the service, which is as affable as it can be, although it seems that the young man manning the ice cream cart did not receive the memo about Six Senses' back-bending style of hospitality.

Facilities at Six Senses Maxwell are one-up from Duxton – there is a gym and a 25-metre long lap pool on the second floor of the property and, in time, a spa will also open. Cook & Tras Social Library on the ground floor also doubles as a library, what with 3,000 books that hotel guests may borrow to read either in the room or at any nook and corner in the beautifully expansive space.

Rooms: 9 / 10
There are 138 rooms and suites in Six Senses Maxwell distributed across seven categories, starting from the lead-in of Cook Street Room. With the exception of some, the rooms are not huge as the hotel had to work within the constraint of existing structures in the heritage building. But what they lack in spaciousness are more than made up by Garcia's trademark style design and quality of finishing, think lush brocade-wrapped headboards; Garcia-designed velvet chairs in damask fabrics; standing lamps with pleated silk lampshades; gorgeous minibars (none of the items are free) fitted in brass, lacquer and marble; and Lafroy Brooks fixtures-adorned bathrooms.

In line with Six Senses' sustainability ethos, filtered water is served from glass – rather than plastic – bottles,bathroom amenities are dispensed from wooden pump bottles and in its bid to be plastic-free by 2020, even the corn starch-made toothbrushes are completely biodegradable. Of course, you will also find a Nespresso machine and tea leaves packed by a teahouse to go with the trio of complimentary organic snacks in glass jars. 

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
For a boutique hotel, there are more than sufficient food and drink options on site to keep hotel guests in. There's all-day Straits Chinese tapas served at Cook & Tras Social Library, which transforms into a cocktail bar by night slinging drinks (try the Sloe Gin and Tonic or Old Fashioned) by mustachioed bar director Ricky Paiva. Murray Terrace Brasserie serves legit French-European classics such as lobster bisque, French onion soup and steak frites (the hamburger does not measure up though), as well as an á la carte breakfast menu (try the sourdough croissant or chicken waffle).

If cocktails are not your cup of tea, there's always Rose Bar & Lounge, which serves rose wines and champagnes; and Garcha's Bar, a whisky appreciation lounge perfect for pre or post dinner sips. For street food, cross the road to Maxwell Food Centre, where you will find some of Singapore's best chicken rice stalls (Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice).

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Double rooms from 330 Singaporean dollars (£188), year-round. Breakfast is excluded and costs around 43 Singaporean dollars (£24). Free Wi-Fi. 

Access for guests with disabilities?
There are two adapted rooms.

Family-Friendly?
Yes, baby cots and extra beds are available in the rooms upon request, as are high chairs and child-sized portions in the restaurants. The unlimited servings of complimentary ice cream alone earn it the status of Singapore's most child-friendly hotel.

12) The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore
A stablemate of the Fullerton Hotel, the glass-clad Fullerton Bay may appear modest compared to the mammoth Marina Bay Sands that it overlooks; but what it lacks in stature it more than makes up for in glamorously machismo style and transcendental views of the bay.

Location: 9 / 10
Standing on concrete stilts over the shimmering waters of Marina Bay, the six-storey Fullerton Bay Hotel is ideal for anyone who wants to be in the heart of the financial district yet within a stone’s throw of the dizzying buzz of Marina Bay and its bustling nightlife. The nearest train station, Raffles Place MRT, is just three minutes’ walk across the OUE bay link bridge. From the Raffles Place MRT, the iconic Singapore Flyer and Art Science Museum are just one stop away at Bayfront MRT.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
The journey says it all: arrive in style via the historic Clifford Pier - once a landing point for the country’s forefathers in 1933- past the dazzling mosaic-paved Landing Point into the hush of the soaring grand reception, where an imposing gilded chandelier hangs. Clad in steel and glass – to take in surrounding views of the Marina Bay skyline – the hotel features prominently along Singapore’s bayfront scape and is truly a place to both see and be seen in.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
Staff are attentive, professional and always obliging; our call for soap and bottled water were swiftly answered and delivered within minutes.

The hotel offers a functional gym and while there isn’t a spa on-site, its sister property, Fullerton Hotel, houses a seven-treatment spa (complimentary limousine transfers are available to all guests who have treatments booked at the spa). On weekday nights (7pm to 8pm only), hotel guests are invited to join the sunset yoga session held at the nearby Clifford Square.

Rooms: 9 / 10
All 100 rooms in the Fullerton Bay hotel are imbued with a touch of masculine glamour by the way of glassy rosewood, sleek leather and chrome fittings. Each room features floor-to-ceiling windows with a balcony offering scenic views of either the triple-decked Marina Bay Sands, the neighbouring Customs House or Clifford Pier.  

By Singapore standards, even the lead-in Deluxe rooms are spacious; all include roomy bathrooms fitted with a bathtub as well as a shower stall. In-room amenities include a tapendium, Bottega Veneta bath amenities (guests of the Theme Suites are given a choice of Bottega Veneta, Hermès or Ferragamo) and a Nespresso machine.  

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
The hotel houses two restaurants, a lounge and a rooftop bar. La Brasserie is an all-day restaurant that serves exquisite French cuisine for lunch and dinner. Highlights include the escargot, steak and frites as well as chateaubriand.

The Landing Point is the place to chill out over an exquisite afternoon tea of savoury lobster cones and truffled egg mayo sandwiches. At dusk, head to Lantern, one of Singapore’s coolest rooftop bars, for mojitos and bar bites such as truffle fries while taking in panoramic views of the Marina Bay Promenade.

For more dining options, take a short stroll to One Fullerton (which plays host to an array of seafood restaurants)or Customs House. Alternatively, a 10-minute walk will bring you to Lau Pa Sat Festival Market – one of Singapore’s famous hawker centres –for local specialities, such as satay and chicken rice.

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Room prices start from 667 Singapore dollars for a Deluxe Room with double occupancy. The rate include Wi-Fi and breakfast at La Brasserie.
Access for guests with disabilities?
Yes. Book the room for disabled guests, which has bathroom railings and lower beds.

Family-Friendly?
Every child is provided with an ice-cream pas, colouring book, 3D puzzle, signature Fullerton teddy bear and Crayola. All dining outlets are also equipped with a child dining chair and set with bathrooms equipped with baby changing tables. Upon request, amenities such as an airpot, baby bathtub, cot, chair, baby soap, cleaning equipment and toilet accessories can be provided upon request.

13) Ann Siang House
Ann Siang House, tucked in the shop house-lined dining enclave of Club Street, offers moderately priced lodging, some equipped with a kitchenette, in elegantly-appointed shop housed-based rooms off Chinatown. 

Location: 8 / 10
Ann Siang House is bang in the Central Business District, a 10 and 15-minute walk away to the Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown metro stops, respectively. Maxwell Road Food Centre is the closest landmark and it's no more than two minutes away on foot. Both Marina Bay Sands and Orchard Road are about 15 to 20 minutes away by taxi. If you prefer to use public transport, the Telok Ayer MRT Station is about eight to 10 minutes on foot.

Style and Character: 7 / 10
The heritage property keeps its public spaces lean and clean. The entrance opens into a reception desk that abuts a minimalist lobby lounge-cum-breakfast room. Outside breakfast hours, guests may help themselves to filtered water in glass bottles, tea as well as coffee from the Jura coffee machine.

Service and Facilities: 7 / 10
There are no swimming pool or gym facilities here. However, you may be surprised to know that there is a laundry room – with a washing machine and a dryer – on the third floor. Every floor also provides a small communal space for working. For a decidedly small property, service by the well-trained staff meets expectation.

Rooms: 9 / 10
Set in a row of heritage shop houses, the boutique property houses 20 rooms in various categories of Premier Room, Deluxe Room, Executive Room, Workout Studio, Junior Suite, Cooking Studio (comes with a kitchenette) and Wellness Suite (comes with a massage chair and a kitchenette). About 20 per cent of the rooms come with a basic kitchenette which is ideal for guests on medium to long stay. Due to the original configuration of the conservation shop houses, each room has a slightly different layout but is swathed in the same soothing grey palette of wood panels, upholstered fabric headboards and blinds. These are teamed with sleek work desks, low-slung dark wood leather seats in varying designs and upholstered benches in colourful hues. Views of the surrounding roads through the original shop house windows are less than inspiring, but the Queen Elizabeth-approved Hypnos beds, down pillows and 400-thread-count duvets more than make up for it.

All rooms come with free Wi-Fi, a Handy Phone for free locals calls and a Nespresso coffee machine, with an added bonus of L'Occitane bath amenities dispensed from pump bottles. Instead of offering mineral water in plastic bottles, it's worth noting that the property is in the process of switching to filtered water in glass bottles. The whitewashed bathrooms with white-tiled walls are some of the prettiest I have seen in a while, but these are let down by door-less shower stalls (often resulting in wet bathrooms). In case you're looking forward to a relaxing soak, only The Cooking Studio, Junior Suite and The Wellness Suite come with an additional bathtub.

Food and Drink: 9 / 10
The lobby lounge is the only place in the property where guests can have breakfast (included in the room rate). Currently a continental spread (think fresh baked goods, charcuterie, cheeses and cereal) by near-by Bakery & Bar is on offer. There are four restaurants and bars in the house – for aperitif before dinner, options are plentiful incuding The Other Roof, which offers sweeping views of the neighbourhood to go with craft cocktails or White Label, a record store by day and a bar by night (ask for signatures like the White Label Iced Tea or Chrysanthemum vodka martini). From hawker fare at Maxwell Food Centre (we highly recommend Tian Tian Chicken Rice) to the line-up of restaurants and bars at Club Street, there is no lack of food and drink offerings on the Ann Siang House's doorstep. Just a few doors away from the property is Lolla, one of the city's best small plate eateries.

Value for Money: 9 / 10
Double rooms from SGD 300 year-round. Breakfast included. Free Wi-Fi.

Access for guests with disabilities?
There are two adapted rooms.

Family-Friendly?
Not particularly. Cots are not available.

14) PARKROYAL on Pickering
This “hotel-in-a-garden” is a stylish place to stay, with four floors boasting balconies covered in lush greenery. It offers excellent views of the city skyline from the outdoor infinity pool, and facilities include a spa, gym, restaurant, and members lounge. The location makes it a handy base for exploring Singapore.

Location: 8 / 10
The Parkroyal is on a busy main road, just a stone’s throw from the Central Business District. It’s also a five-minute walk from the Waterfront at Clarke Quay, and a five-minute taxi ride to popular sights including Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Public transport links are easily accessible, with the Chinatown MRT station just two minutes’ walk down the road.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
The Parkroyal’s stand-out feature is its innovative design. The novel “hotel-in-a-garden” concept behind it is realised through four floors covered with vegetation – the hotel features more than 15,000 square-metres of lush gardens, waterfalls and planter terraces. Memorable too is the outdoor pool with cabanas that resemble colourful birdcages, and the lobby bordered with reflecting pools of water, creating a natural oasis in the middle of Singapore’s starkly urban landscape.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
The comprehensive wellness floor includes a 300-metre walking track that goes around the entire hotel, an infinity pool and hot tub, a gym and a spa offering a range of luxury treatments. Staff are helpful and knowledgeable about the area (in search of shoes, I was clearly directed to the nearest big shopping malls).

Rooms: 7 / 10
Superior rooms are a good size, with a light and airy feel and modern design. The king-sized beds are wonderfully comfortable and although the hotel is on a busy road, the windows and black-out blinds are heavy enough that light and noise aren’t an issue when it comes to sleeping. Rooms offer views across Chinatown and Hong Lim Park, and on the sky-garden floors windows are bordered by verdant plant life.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
The Lime restaurant and bar on the ground floor serves modern Asian and international cuisine. Signature dishes include everything from warm-fried jumbo prawns to hand-pulled pizza. For those staying in Orchid Club rooms (from £174), access to the rooftop member's lounge means you get an afternoon tea and champagne breakfast included in the price of your room, with pastries, pancakes and fruit on offer in addition to cooked breakfast items. This is also a great spot to grab a pre-dinner cocktail while enjoying panoramic views of the skyline.

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Superior rooms from £137 in low season; rising to £207 at Chinese New Year. Orchid Club rooms from £174. Breakfast excluded (£15). Free Wi-Fi.

Access for guests with disabilities?
Accessibility features include a driveway ramp, disabled-friendly guestrooms and toilets, and lift-access on every floor.

Family-Friendly?
While not actively discouraged, the Parkroyal is not particularly targeted at the family market – there’s a grown-up vibe throughout and parents are asked not to take children to the members lounge.

15) Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong
Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong (“Hotel Indigo”) pays tribute to the rich Peranakan heritage of the Katong neighbourhood of Joo Chiat, the city’s first designated Heritage Town, with a vibrant Straits Chinese-inspired design.

Location: 8 / 10
Set in the Katong neighbourhood of Joo Chiat, Hotel Indigo offers guests the opportunity to go off the beaten track to explore the often-ignored eastern fringe of the city that happens to be extremely colourful and vibrant. Situated opposite the 112 Katong mall, the hotel is a mere 20-minute taxi ride to the Changi Airport, Singapore Expo and the Changi Business Park.

Given its lack of access to the MRT station (the nearest ones are Dakota and Paya Lebar MRT stations and they are both 10 minutes from the hotel by cab), transport to Orchard Road and the Marina Bay area is more convenient by taxi and should take you no more than 20 minutes. The East Coast Park waterfront, popular among locals for recreational activities like beach BBQ, cycling and jogging, is not far from here but best reached by taxi.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
Hotel Indigo pays tribute to the rich Peranakan heritage of the neighbourhood where it resides with a vibrant Straits Chinese design theme that integrates the historic former Joo Chiat Police Station built in 1928 (now housing the resident eatery, Baba Chews Bar & Eatery, and a number of leased out food outlets) to a brand new multi-storey building with a contemporary façade that includes a panel of vertical garden at the hotel entrance.

The heritage theme is evident from the time you enter the hotel lobby, where a feature wall bearing a collage of Peranakan ceramic patterns holds court to the hotel pavilion overhung with colourful lanterns, where a pop-up 1960s “mama stall” (a convenience stall usually found in housing estates) doubles-up as a book stand. During check-in, guests are welcomed with a choice of tea or hot/cold latte brewed with locally roasted beans.

Service and Facilities: 7 / 10
Apart from a 24-hour gym and a rooftop infinity pool, the boutique hotel does not offer much in terms of facilities, but you won't miss it given the diversity of shops in the neighbourhood. Service is courteous and well meaning, but despite a few repeated requests for bottled water, none was delivered to our room until the third or fourth call. Turn down service was also overlooked in one of the inter-connecting rooms we were staying in.

Rooms: 9 / 10
The 131 guestrooms (no suites) - Deluxe, Premier and Premier with bathtub - are fashioned in the style of a Peranakan home with wall murals of Katong's street scene by a local urban sketcher. Each hotel room entrance features a living area with carrom board as coffee tabletop, a cane furniture-inspired sofa and a minibar fashioned after a traditional display cabinet. This leads into the sleeping area with batik printed cushions and headboard with Peranakan motifs. Further in is the shower/bath area decked in Peranakan-inspired tiles featuring a floor-to-ceiling window and a classic enamel basin bowl stacked atop a marble-topped Singer sewing machine base serving as a vanity counter.

The most basic Deluxe room category comes with no Nespresso coffee machine and no bathtub. There are only 12 Premium rooms with bath tub here, those without tubs make up for it by providing an enamel wash basin with a range of Biology Smart Skincare products (bath salts, exfoliating foot scrub and a soothing foot balm) for a DIY foot spa experience. All rooms are provided with Biology Smart Skincare essential oils-infused bath amenities. 

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
There is only one dining outlet on site and, befitting its location in a Peranakan-themed hotel, Baba Chews Bar & Eastery serves a Peranakan-inspired menu headlined at dinner by a clutch of stellar dishes like beef short rib rendang, goreng chilli barramundi, pong tauhu soup and dessert of kueh durian.

Breakfast is a limited buffet of cold options and pastries matched with a menu of cooked-to-order hot food like eggs Benedict, kaya toast set, Belgian waffles and daily-changing specials that featured "mee siam" (thin rice noodles in  a spicy, sweet and sour light gravy) and "wanton noodles" (noodles with dumplings) during our visit.

16) Naumi
This 10-year-old boutique hotel in the heart of town offers 73 well designed rooms with chic interiors. Standing at 10 storeys high, the creeper-clad metallic façade stands out prominently among the shops that line Seah Street.

Location: 9 / 10
Like its grand dame neighbour, Raffles Hotel Singapore, Naumi sits in a prime location at Seah Street. It takes no more than five minutes to walk to either the City Hall or Esplanade MRT Station, and Raffles City Shopping Centre; the financial district is just one train stop away and Marina Bay Sands is five to 10 minutes by taxi. It is also located near Clarke Quay which plays host to a variety of dining and entertainment options with a booming night scene.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
Clean lines, neutral tones, earthy wood and the occasional artsy furniture piece mingle to create the contemporary design theme in this boutique hotel – look out for B&B Italia furnishings, Poltrona Frau sofas, Moroso carpets, Artemide and Foscarini Diesel lamps and Magis’ Piña armchairs dotted throughout the property.

The hotel is home to an international art collection, featuring specially commissioned artworks – such as Jonathan Adler’s hippo installations and the four-storey graffiti mural displayed across the hotels exterior – to create a near-surreal sensory experience

Service and Facilities: 7 / 10
The service is efficient, knowledgeable and professional. The Cloud 9 infinity pool and bar located on the hotel’s rooftop is the perfect place to unwind with panoramic view of the Singapore skyline, it should be noted that the bar only serves hotel guests. The fitness room on the same floor is also an option for gym bunnies.

Rooms: 8 / 10
The contemporary theme continues in all 73 rooms, categorised from Habitat, Patio to Designer Inspired Rooms (the ‘Gabrielle & Camillia’ rooms inspired by Coco Chanel and ‘Eden &  Nirwana’ by Andy Warhol). Generally speaking, the rooms are not huge but are cleverly designed to maximise space: ironing boards are neatly tucked below the beds, while the Nespresso coffee machine, T2 tea, cups and glasses are available in retractable shelves hidden behind the walls.

Bedding boasts 300-thread count Egyptian cotton but, while comfortable, the bed in our Habitat room felt short. This category is great for no-frills travellers but if you’re looking for something a little out of the ordinary, pick one of the Designer Inspired Rooms (the Andy Warhol-inspired rooms clinched the “Best Interior Design for Suite” award at the inaugural Asia Hotel Awards in 2015).

The four Patio rooms are also an experience with an extended outdoor terrace for guests to unwind on a daybed after a taxing day but if you rather unwind in a bathtub, book the Oasis rooms. A private floor (on the third level) is also available for couples or females travelling alone. All rooms come complete with breakfast, a Nespresso machine, SOAK Superfood bath amenities, complimentary minibar and technology flourishes (high-speed free Wi-Fi and an Apple TV).

Food and Drink: 7 / 10
There is only one restaurant in the establishment – Table. A stablemate of the renown Rang Mahal, a fine dining Indian restaurant group, it serves a daily buffet breakfast as well as Indian-centric à la carte lunch and dinner (don’t miss the chicken tikka masala, dhal and unique Chilli Cheese thin pizza – a unique pizza-like creation that comes with a delicious chilli mix). There is a plethora of wallet-friendly hawker options in the vicinity of the hotel, in case you want to try local street food.

Value for Money: 9 / 10
Rooms rates start at 270 Singapore dollars (£146) per night inclusive of WiFi. Breakfast comes at an additional 26 Singapore dollars (£14).

Access for guests with disabilities?
Only one room is equipped with special configuration for guests with disabilities.

Family-Friendly?

17) Sofitel Singapore City Centre
The sleek Sofitel Singapore City Centre is a city sanctuary that straddles bustling Chinatown and the Central Business District, set right in the heart of the historic Tanjong Pagar enclave. 

Location: 8 / 10
Located right above the Tanjong Pagar MRT station, the modern hotel structure nestles comfortably amid low-rise heritage shophouses and towering skyscrapers. The financial district itself is just a three-minute train stop away at the Raffles Place interchange station. Change trains there for a quick journey to the the premier Orchard Road shopping locale. A 10-minute taxi ride from the hotel would get you to the Orchard vicinity easily too.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
Singapore’s garden city vibe is all around in artful abundance. The hotel’s modern interiors, with its muted earthy palette, are enlivened with vivid botanical motifs and sculptural lighting. The lobby houses Singapour Je T’aime, a stunning nine-metre-long art installation of shimmering hand blown crystalline leaves that twists and whirls high up across the ceiling. Racines, the restaurant on the fifth floor, has an even more eye-catching set-up, with floor-to-ceiling windows flooding the area with natural light while showcasing the rich lush greenery beyond.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
Check-in is seamless and takes just five minutes. The thoughtful gesture of a refreshing lemongrass pandan drink with honey and a cold towel is appreciated on arrival. Staff are polite and enthusiastic throughout the hotel, with the friendly warmth especially apparent in the restaurants and bars. The 24-hour SoFit fitness centre, 30-metre long infinity pool and lushly landscaped gardens are highlights. There is also easy access to the Virgin Active gym next door.

Rooms: 8 / 10
Within the property’s spectrum of 223 rooms are 50 executive club rooms, 13 suites and one signature suite. Each standard room offers floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping views that encompass a lively hotchpotch of green pockets, winding side lanes, colourful traditional shophouses and towering office structures. An big bath is complemented with French-made amenities. The Sofitel MyBeds are sink-in comfy. Rooms also have a Bose soundsystem, Nespresso coffee machine and a minibar with free and chargeable drinks and snacks. The room safe has laptop storage capability.

Upgrade to a Club room, which are bigger and located on higher floors, and you get access to Club Millesime, which has perks like cocktail hours and high tea, plus a complimentary minibar in the room. 

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
Racines, led by executive chef Jean-Charles Dubois, serves both elegant French and traditional Chinese cuisine, using seasonal ingredients. The wagyu beef cheek, for instance, slow cooked for 48 hours, and topped off with truffled mashed potatoes and seasonal greens, is exceptional. For signature cocktails check out 1864. Breakfast offers French classics like charcuterie; Chinese fare like dim sum; and local favourites like nasi lemak (a Malay fragrant rice dish). There is also a selection of low-calorie dishes. Breakfast costs £23 per person.

18) The St. Regis Singapore
If it’s opulence you seek, look no further. At a first glance, St Regis’ metal and glass-clad façade may be mistaken for an office tower, but the fleet of gleaming Bentleys parked at the hotel’s entrance gives a glimpse of what to expect indoors at this luxury-laced city hotel, which welcomed Prince Harry in 2017.

Location: 8 / 10
On the fringe of Orchard Road, this hotel offers easy access to the city’s swanky malls, with both the Orchard MRT station and the lush and undulating greenery of the Singapore Botanic Garden an eight-minute stroll away. The most efficient way to get to the Central Business District would be by taxi.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
There are certain things -– like chauffeur-driven Bentley transfers and decadent treatments at the Remède spa – available at the 299-room St Regis, a luxurious place to spend and splurge. The experience is further heightened by the exquisite artworks – worth approximately S$10 million (£5 million) – which dot the part-Beaux Arts, part-Chinoiserie-style public spaces. Exhibits include paintings by masters such as Picasso and Chen Ke Zhan, and sculptures by Fernando Botero and Jenkell Laurence, which can all be viewed by way of the hotel’s art tour held daily at 6pm (reservatons required). These artworks, along with the built-in mural, “A Gathering of The Immortals”,have been amassed and commissioned by the hotel owner’s wife.

Service and Facilities: 9 / 10
On the whole, service is impeccable. Butlers, who are assigned to all rooms and suites, are well trained to attend to your every need including packing/unpacking your luggage, firing up internet access on your laptop and whipping up a pot of hot chocolate for the kids upon arrival. Furthermore, there is a complimentary pressing service for two pieces of garments per person, per room, per day. The Remède spa has five treatment rooms and a two-room mani-pedi studio by Bastien Gonzalez. It also features a Finnish sauna, ice fountain and a steam chamber. Other facilities include a pool and tennis court. 

Rooms: 8 / 10
The well-appointed Art Deco-style rooms are spacious and feature sumptuous leather-bound bedheads against Chinoiserie silk-panelled walls, quaint chandeliers, fuschia glass bubble table lamps and luxurious French marble-clad bathrooms with amenities from Remède spa. There are eight different room categories, starting with Executive Deluxe and Grand Deluxe rooms (50 to 52 square metres), up to the King Cole suite (135 square metres) and the Presidential suite (335 square metres).

The majority of the rooms overlook neighbouring upscale residential apartments and the hotel’s pool and tennis court. For views of the luciously-framed Tanglin and Nassim enclave, ask for a Grand Deluxe rooms. Complimentary coffee and tea is available around the clock, personally served by the hotel’s butlers. Guests staying in the Suites may enjoy a complimentary cocktail and canapé at the Astor Bar daily from 6pm to 10pm.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
There are six food and drinking spots. For top-notch sushi, head to the one Michelin-starred Shinji by Kanesaka, helmed by chef Kikuchi Shunsuke, where sushi set courses are available from S$125 (£72) and an excellent tasting menu ("Omakase Wa") from S$300 (£160). The Chef’s Omakase is priced at S$500 (£270); watch out for the finale rice course where raw sea urchin and chopped fatty tuna belly abound.

Alternatively, pick from LaBrezza’s contemporary Italian fare (think risotto with raw red prawn on a bed of prawn bisque) to fine Cantonese dining at Yan Ting, and French cuisine and afternoon tea at Brasserie Les Saveurs. For breakfast, the brasserie also serves salads, fresh bread, pastries and charcuterie from a buffet, with a separate à la carte menu (try the epicurean omelette with poached lobster and tiger prawn on a bed of Cognac-scented lobster bisque).

For a slice of pre-dinner sophistication, unwind over cocktails at the Astor Bar. For lovers of the spicy and tangy, try their tongue-searing Chili Padi Mary.

Value for Money: 7 / 10
Double rooms from S$450 (£243), excluding breakfast (S$47/£25 per adult; S$22/£12 per child under 12 years old). Free Wi-Fi.

19) Mandarin Oriental, Singapore
This fan-shaped Marina Square stalwart boasts luxuriously appointed rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows framing postcard-perfect views of the ocean, the bay or the city. 

Location: 9 / 10
Located along Marina Bay, the hotel is connected by an indoor walkway to the massive Marina Square Mall, which houses a plethora of shops, restaurants and bars. The Singapore Flyer and Esplanade theatres on the Bay are both steps away from the hotel, as is the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. Public transportation is also a breeze — the Promenade MRT station is just a stone's throw away while the Esplanade MRT station is no more than 10 minutes away on foot. Both Marina Bay Sands and the Central Business District can be accessed via a five-minute taxi ride. Orchard Road is a little further but will take you no longer than 15 minutes by taxi.

Style and Character: 8 / 10
Its austere, concrete façade may look dated relative to the city's cadre of towering glass and steel-clad skyscrapers, but this quietly confident luxury hotel still has a strong following. Despite its age (it was built in 1987), the public spaces still look as alluring as before — think a dimly lit lobby decked with art installations and a soaring atrium overhung with a 15-metre-long crystal chandelier. However, this zen temple comes under stress during the 12 noon peak period when hoards of hotel guests crowd the lobby to check in and out.

Service and Facilities: 8 / 10
From the spa, swimming pool and business centre to the gymnasium, fitness centre and outdoor yoga patio, there is no lack of facilities. Service is always top notch and polite no matter how busy the staff are.

Rooms: 8 / 10
There are a staggering 527 rooms and suites. Admittedly, you will not feel its sheer scale once you’re cocooned in your room and treated to a postcard-perfect view of either the ocean (by far my favourite), the bay or the city. Outfitted in a neutral palette with a gridded wooden wall panel, olive-coloured bedspread, textured headboard and lush carpets, the rooms are elegantly luxurious. However, despite the recent spruce-up, some furnishings – like the TV cabinet – are looking slightly washed out.

Book one of the 59 suites if you want to pamper yourself. The Premier Suite, for instance, comes with an airy living-cum-dining room, plus a separate master bedroom with its own living area. All rooms come with tea-making facilities, but Nespresso coffee machines are only available in suites and Club rooms. House brand Mandarin Citrus bath amenities feature in all rooms, but the more luxurious Atelier Cologne bath range is also only available in the higher-category rooms.

Food and Drink: 8 / 10
There are more than enough restaurants and bars within the property to keep guests satiated. Of note is Dolce Vita, which serves classic Italian cuisine – try the treccia mozzarella served tableside with rocket leaves, anchovies and sundried tomatoes, as well as the homemade taglolini with Umbria sausage, ricotta, spinach and black truffle. Its à la carte weekend buffet brunch with free-flowing champagne is popular with the expat community.

Steak lovers should not miss a trip to Morton’s the Steakhouse for the legendary Morton’s Martini that comes with a free flow of complimentary fillet mignon steak sandwiches from 5pm to 7pm daily. Cherry Garden is popular with the nearby office crowd for its dim sum. Melt Café, which serves an international buffet spread, impresses with quantity but not quality. If these options do not suit you, more options abound in the adjoining Marina Square Mall. 

Value for Money: 7 / 10
Double rooms from S$446 (£242), including buffet breakfast at Melt Café. Free Wi-Fi. Note that some packages do not include breakfast and Wi-Fi. 

Access for guests with disabilities?
There is one room with a wider shower area with handles.

Family-Friendly?
Apart from the family-friendly buffet with a chocolate fountain at Melt and the gorgeous pool, there is nothing particularly appealing to families at the hotel. Baby cots are available upon request.

20) Villa Samadhi Singapore
Villa Samadhi stands out in urban Singapore as it is the only resort villa to be set in a lush nature reserve. Bucolic and peaceful, it provides a pleasant refuge from the city rat race with its old-world atmosphere and restful ambiance. 

Location: 9 / 10
The hotel is nestled amidst the verdant greenery of Labrador Nature Reserve – a 54-acre park that is teeming with heritage and biodiversity. The nearest Labrador MRT station is 10 minutes on foot. A drive to VivoCity, Sentosa and the Singapore Cruise Centre from here will take about 10 minutes; Chinatown 20 minutes; the Civic District, the Central Business District and the Singapore Changi Airport about 30 minutes.

Style and Character: 9 / 10
Time comes to a standstill here, completely aided by the bucolic setting and the hotel's rustic colonial charm. Housed in a 1920s black and white building that once served as a British army garrison and a halfway house before it fell into neglect, the bungalow has been carefully restored to instil an air of old Malayan charm and, at the same time, reflecting Singapore's colonial past.

Shutters and floorboards have been renovated with decades-old recycled wood from abandoned kampong houses, and broken or missing roof tiles replaced with those from the original manufacturer. Throughout the hotel's public spaces you will see vintage centrepieces collected from the owner's journeys in East Asia; look out for the antique Myanmar wooden bank teller in the hotel's reception, the antique Indian four posted bed in the library and the leather armchairs in the bar. 

Service and Facilities: 7 / 10
There may not be a swimming pool, spa, tennis court or gym here, but the idea of checking in to this villa is not to do any of these. Instead, guests are intended to relax, unwind and reconnect with nature.

Service is laid back but spot-on.

Rooms: 8 / 10
Villa Samadhi offers a total of just 20 rooms in categories of Crib, Luxe Crib, Sarang and Luxe Sarang. All the rooms come with a slightly different layout but share a common colonial theme of simple dark wood furnishings set against whitewashed walls, recycled wood and cement flooring, as well as restored original windows. There are no sofas in most of the rooms (you would have to watch TV in bed) although there are two wooden armchairs for each room located along the corridor.

The bathrooms are generously sized with white ceramic tiles and in-house bath amenities; some rooms come with a sunken whirlpool bath, and three come with wooden bathtubs. Guests have Newby Teas and instant coffee sachets to keep themselves hydrated. Instead of bottled water, you get boiled water served from a copper pot. Turndown service is unusually special as it comes with a nightcap of Port. A handy phone with unlimited data is available in each room for hotel guests to make unlimited calls free-of-charge to selected countries.

Food and Drink: 7 / 10
The Library serves a pedestrian cold buffet spread for breakfast (hot items are available for order from a menu), a welcome tea of open-faced sandwiches and scones with Newby tea, and an afternoon tea of local cakes and snacks. The adjoining bar offers an hour of complimentary cocktails (from a list of five) at 6pm. Remarkably, these are all included in the room rate.

Just two minutes walk away from the villa via a forested wooden walkway, Tamarind Hill serves Thai fare like pomelo salad with shrimps, tom yum soup with river lobster, roasted duck curry with lychee and mango sticky rice. If you don't mind catching a cab out, Naked Finn at nearby Gilman Barracks serves top notch seafood while Alexander Food Centre fields heart-warming hawker fare like chicken rice.

Value for Money: 8 / 10
Rooms start from 315 Singaporean dollars (£180) in the low season to 395 Singaporean dollars (£227) in the high season. The rate includes Wi-Fi, breakfast for two, welcome tea, afternoon tea, cocktail hour at the Library daily, and a complimentary nightcap of Port and chocolates. The retreat also offers complimentary laundry (for four piece) for guests who stay for two evenings or more.

Access for guests with disabilities?
The rooms are not accessible for guests with disabilities.

Family-Friendly?
The hotel does not allow children below the age of 12.
