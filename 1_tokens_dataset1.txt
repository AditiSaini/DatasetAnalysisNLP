“raffles

somerset
maugham
a
playwright
once
wrote
stepping

imagines
that
it
could
be
a
reverie
of
singapore’s
colonial
past
every
fixture
installation
and
detail
including
the
liveried
sikh
doormen
is
meant
to
enhance
the
hotel’s
old
world
splendour
the
gravel
driveway
is
reminiscent
of
an
era
past
when
horse
drawn
carriages
once
chauffeured
the
hotel’s
guests
and
the
antique
grandfather
clock
one
of
the
hotel’s
oldest
pieces
of
furniture
stands
as
a
testament
to
raffles
hotel’s
status
as
a
national
monument
what’s
new
is
the
mammoth
bohemian
chandelier
from
the
czech
republic
that
glistens
with
8
214
pieces
of
crystals
hung
from
the
